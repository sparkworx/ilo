Release Notes - ILO: 2.1

2184883: Report per widget (normalized) response time cost
	Added new parameter to END_TASK to allow tracking of widget counts by end user.

2155867: Unbrand for shared use by Hotsos and Method R.
	Rename objects with ILO_ prefix. Backward compatibility maintained during upgrade
	through use of appropriate synonyms.

1998901: Remove unnecessary grants to public (2549)
	Public execute privilege will no longer be granted on the ILO_SYSUTIL package during
	installation.
      
1998871: Persist database version and others (3052)
	The database version is now determined at installation and stored in package globals. 
	If a database upgrade is done, ILO should be modified manually (in ILO_SYSUTIL
	package), or reinstalled from scratch.

1998857: Use autonomous transactions to avoid implicit commits (2190)
	The DBMS_ALERT functions which are wrapped in ILO_SYSUTIL are now wrapped with
	the PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION to avoid implicit commits being passed along
	to the calling application. These functions were called only by the SLA Manager
	extension, which wrapped them in the calls, but the pragmas belong at this level.

1917: Installation will now fail immediately if unable to grant privileges on SYS packages
	to avoid creating ILO_SYSUTIL which won't compile.
      
Release Notes - Hotsos ILO: 2.0

***:  Installation scripts and instructions were modified to increase user friendliness. 

298:  Added uninstall script
     
      Hotsos_ilo_uninstall.sql is now included in distribution.

905,1606:  BEGIN_TASK should call ILO_TIMER function to get Trace status for MODULE/ACTION

      The method hotsos_ilo_timer.get_config is now responsible for determining the status
      of each MODULE/ACTION pair for tracing, as well as the desired nesting level. This 
      method is now called from hotsos_ilo_task.BEGIN_TASK.
      NOTE: hotsos_ilo_task.set_config and set_nesting_level are now deprecated.
     
1666: "Mark all tasks interesting" for testing

      A developer who wishes to unit test his code can call 
      HOTSOS_ILO_TIMER.SET_MARK_ALL_TASKS_INTERESTING(TRUE,TRUE) to override the
      normal GET_CONFIG schedule, but calls to this method are typically not going
      to be present in production code unless they are implemented as menu options
      (for example, Help > Debug > Trace All). The decision about whether or not
      to trace should be reserved until runtime.

1293,1646: Begin and end a task with a specified time

      BEGIN_TASK, END_TASK, and END_ALL_TASKS now have timestamp parameters which can
      be used to specify a begin and end time. Default behavior remains if these are
      left out or null.
      
1450: Add 'do not change module/action' parameter for Oracle Applications

      In an Oracle Applications environment, changing the session's MODULE/ACTION
      can have adverse affects. This code can now be overridden.
      This was implemented as a set of methods in hotsos_ilo_task:
      SET_IS_APPS(is_apps boolean);
      GET_IS_APPS RETURN BOOLEAN;
      
1586: Add a 'do not ignore exceptions' parameter or method for users of ILO

      For development and testing, a set of methods was added to hotsos_sysutil:
      SET_RAISE_EXCEPTIONS(raise_exceptions BOOLEAN);
      GET_RAISE_EXCEPTIONS RETURNS BOOLEAN;
      
      Default is FALSE - Don't propagate exceptions.
      
1712: Remove literal from procedure call in BEGIN_TASK

      Use a variable for call to hotsos_sysutil.write_to_trace to improve 
      performance. 
      
1722: Allow multiple ILO installs in single database instance

      The installation now creates the HOTSOS_SYSUTIL package in the HOTSOS schema
      instead of SYS. Appropriate grants are now needed for the HOTSOS schema to access
      the SYS packages and tables, and these are detailed in the Install.txt file. The
      public synonyms are still created, but a warning will be given if they already exist.
      If multiple HOTSOS schemas are desired, the correct management of public and 
      private synonyms is the responsibility of the developer/dba.

1721: ILO_LOGOFF_TRG trigger should handle errors gracefully

      ILO_LOGOFF_TRG trigger is still installed in SYS, but will scope to the "correct"
      HOTSOS schema based on the current user. It will no longer be marked invalid if
      the HOTSOS schema or packages are dropped. 

1777: SET_CONFIG temporarily modified to call SET_MARK_ALL_TASKS_INTERESTING

      In order to assist migration from 1.5 to 2.0, SET_CONFIG() in 2.0 will turn tracing
      on similar to 1.5. See doc for explanation. This will not be supported in future 
      releases, so developers should start using the new calls.
      
Release Notes - Hotsos ILO: 1.5

***: Added methods and globals to reduce number of calls to SYS_CONTEXT
     hotsos_sysutil.get_ip_address
     hotsos_sysutil.get_terminal
     hotsos_sysutil.get_session_id
     hotsos_sysutil.get_os_user

***: Added BNL (beyond nesting level) to the task record

***: Modified several methods to utilize database version correctly

***: Corrected code in hotsos_sysutil.get_session_user

Release Notes - Hotsos ILO: 1.4

***: Added error_num attribute to the end_task and end_all_tasks procedures

     This would allow the hotsos_ilo_timer to recognize when errors occur 
     and store in the ilo_run table

     Several performance enhancements to SYS.HOTSO_SYSUTIL package to read data 
     once per session and cache it from that point on. 

Release Notes - Hotsos ILO: 1.3

***: Version 7 - 9 hotsos_sysutil.turn_trace_off wouldn't stop tracing

     hotsos_sysutil.turn_trace_off made the following call to stop tracing :
         exec_str := 'BEGIN dbms_support.start_trace(FALSE, FALSE); END;';
     When it should have been :
         exec_str := 'BEGIN dbms_support.stop_trace; END;';
	 

Release Notes - Hotsos ILO: 1.2

297: Alter installation scripts to install properly across versions.

     Altered the install script to identify which version of the database 
     (<= 9 or >=10) on which the software was being installed, and to automatically 
     check for and install the necessary supporint DBMS packages.

     Altered HOTSOS_SYSUTIL to use dynamic SQL based on database version number to 
     execute the correct DBMS package for turning on 10046 level trace.


366: Add utility functions for retrieval of SPID and CLIENT TYPE;

     Implemented 2 new utility functions in HOTSOS_UTIL:

     GET_SPID returns the SPID from V$PROCESS for the current session

     GET_SESSION_TYPE returns the TYPE column vrom V$SESSION for the current session.

299: Add "VERSION" function to ILO

     Implemented a GET_VERSION function in all packages that returns the current version of ILO.

301: Calls to Begin Task with no Client ID are not formulating one as expected

     HOTSOS_ILO_TASK.BEGIN_TASK was comparing MODULE, ACTION and CLIENT_ID against '' 
     when it should have been comparing against NULL. This had the side effect of not 
     consistantly setting MODULE, ACTION and CLIENT_ID to the correct values when a NULL was passed.

302: Final END_TASK call does not re-instate what might have been in place before it.

     Altered HOTSOS_ILO_TASK package to capture the pre-existing MODULE and ACTION info which 
     may have been in play before the initial BEGIN_TASK call, and re-instantiate it after the 
     final END_TASK call.

300: Missing code in the examples in the ILO package text.
   
     Updated the documentation where a code example was incomplete.
